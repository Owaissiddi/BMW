        has been in use since 2010, as the race car for Group GT3 customer  racing. For
        the racetrack, the large coupe has to lose weight – more than 600  kg. Moreover,
        there are extensive aerodynamic modifications and further  adaptations required 
        for racing. For example, the outer shell is made of carbon  fibre reinforced plastic
        in order to meet the guidelines for GT3 vehicles.

    The motorsport division of BMW, headed by Jochen Neerpasch, had been wanting to 
    compete in motorsports using a car developed for competition racing, in order to
    compete with arch rival Porsche in Group-5 racing. Thus, the development of the 
    M1 was initiated. Neerpasch, who was head of the development program, stressed 
    that the car was to be strictly mid-engine in order to outclass its competitors.

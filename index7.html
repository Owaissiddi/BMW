        <p><i>Price: Jawa Perak price for its variant - Perak Standard starts at Rs. 2,15,543. The mentioned Perak price is the average ex-showroom.<br><br>

            Jawa Perak is a cruiser bike available in only 1 variant and 1 colour. The Jawa Perak is powered by 334cc BS6 engine which develops a<br>
            power of 30.2 bhp and a torque of 32.74 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Jawa Perak comes up with anti-locking braking system.<br>
            This Perak bike weighs 185 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 13.2 liters.<br><br>
            
            The Perak is a historic brand for Jawa, and the name has been resurrected by the company for a factory-custom bobber. The motorcycle <br>
            was showcased for the first time during the launch of the brand and after a year it has been now officially launched in the country.<br><br>
            
            Being a factory-custom styled bobber, the Perak is one gorgeous looking motorcycle. It features a typical low-slung profile with a<br>
            longer wheelbase as compared to the other Jawa models. It follows a blacked-out theme with a matte black-grey paint job and a black<br>
            coloured theme for most of its mechanical parts. The design is accentuated with gold pinstriping on the fuel tank, side panels and <br>
            fenders. The other biggest highlight of the motorcycle is the floating seat design with a tan-brown leather seat that gives the Perak<br>
            the classic bobber stance.<br><br>
            
            In terms of equipment, the Perak comes with conventional halogen lamp all around except for the tail lamp which is LED. The instrument <br>
            cluster is a circular unit with a small digital unit for the odometer which has been lifted from the Jawa Standard. The motorcycle rides<br>
            on telescopic forks up front and a monoshock mount below the seat for the rear. Braking is done by disc brakes at both ends, fortified by<br>
            dual-channel ABS.<br><br>
            
            As for the powertrain, the Perak gets a slightly larger 334cc engine compared to the Jawa Standard and Forty-Two. It continues to be a <br>
            single-cylinder unit with liquid-cooling and is capable of churning out 30bhp and 31Nm in terms of power output figures. Transmission <br>
            duties are handled by a six-speed gearbox.<br><br>
            
            For its price and styling, the Jawa Perak competes against the likes of the Royal Enfield Classic 500 in the market.</i></p><br><br>

            builders. The three variants that the Shotgun 650 is available in are - Custom Shed, Custom Pro, and Custom Special.<br><br>
            
            
            The Shotgun 650 is offered in four paint schemes – Green Drill, Stencil White, Sheet Metal Grey, and Plasma Blue. Being a Bobber-style<br>
            motorcycle, it is sold as a single-seater in its stock form, but the company will also offer an accessory pillion seat, which can be converted<br>
            into a luggage rack, simply by removing it.<br><br>
            
            
            The Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 is powered by a 648cc, parallel-twin motor that pumps out 46.40bhp at 7,250rpm and a peak torque of 52.3Nm at <br>
            5,650rpm. The oil-cooled engine is paired to a six-speed gearbox, with a slipper clutch.<br><br>
            
            
            Coming to its cycle parts, the Shotgun 650 has alloy wheels at both ends, shod with a 100/90-18 cross-ply tyre at the front and a 150/70 R17 <br>
            radial tyre at the rear. Braking duties are taken care of by a 320mm disc up front and a 300mm disc at the rear. Dual-channel ABS comes as<br>
            standard.<br><br>

            The Shotgun 650 gets a suspension travel of 120mm at the front and 90mm at the back. Further, it comes with a fuel tank capacity of 13.8 <br>
            litres and has a kerb weight of 240kg.<br><br>
            
            
            The design of the Shotgun 650 is attractive with the fuel tank, side panels, and fenders, along with the low-slung stance of the bike adding<br>
            to its visual appeal.<br><br>
            
            
            While the bike doesn’t have any direct competition, since there is no Bobber-style bike at this price point, the other 650cc option that you<br>
            can look at is the Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650.<br>

    <p>Without road-car regulations to hold it back, the P1™ GTR pushes everything to the limit. Available only to P1™ owners, production of the track-focused GTR began upon completion of the 375th and final road car. The mid-mounted powerplant has an output of 1,000PS (986bhp) and includes an ERS-style push-to-pass system. The large fixed rear wing features a Formula 1™-derived Drag Reduction System and the wing mirrors have been repositioned to the A pillars to put them closer to the eye line of the driver and reduce aerodynamic drag. The car sits at a fixed ride height on race-prepared suspension over 19-inch motorsport alloy wheels. Below the rear wing is the exposed, centrally mounted inconel and titanium alloy exhaust. This all new straight cut twin pipe design has been developed exclusively for the GTR.</p>
    <p>McLaren P1™ GTR ownership can include participation in driving events at some of the world's most iconic circuits with specialist vehicle support. Also available is access to McLaren racing simulators with driver training from experts that have helped develop and train Formula 1™ champions. In addition, exclusive consultations with the McLaren driver fitness team and Design Director Frank Stephenson are included in the programme. Together with one of the most exciting track-focused cars ever developed, the programme offers unprecedented access to the technologies, resources and people throughout the McLaren Technology Centre. Every experience is unique and tailored specifically for each participant.</p>
